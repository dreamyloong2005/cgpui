# CGPUI GPUI-Core Progress

## 2026-06-29

- Created the 20-step plan for the Windows/Linux GPUI-core milestone.
- Started Step 1: EventResult.
- Completed Step 1 implementation in `codex/core-event-result`.
- Verified targeted tests: `xmake test -P . window_runtime_test/default ui_header_cleanliness/default render_view_test/default` passed 3/3.
- Verified Windows full debug tests: `xmake f -c -m debug -P .; xmake test -P .` passed 19/19.
- Verified WSL Arch Linux full debug tests: `XMAKE_ROOT=y xmake f -y -c -m debug -P . && XMAKE_ROOT=y xmake test -y -P .` passed 16/16.
- Started Step 2: Event dispatch observability.
- Added design and implementation plan docs for event dispatch records and the after-event callback.
- Added a RED runtime test for `EventDispatchRecord`, `EventKind`, `WindowRuntimeContext::last_event_dispatch`, and `WindowRuntime::set_after_event_callback`; the test failed because those APIs did not exist.
- Implemented Step 2 in `codex/event-dispatch-observability`: dispatch records include sequence, target root view id, event kind, and event result; runtime after-event callbacks see the current record after view handling.
- Fixed a test-only aggregation bug where a boolean accumulator started as `false`, then re-ran the target test.
- Verified targeted tests: `xmake test -P . window_runtime_test/default ui_header_cleanliness/default render_view_test/default` passed 3/3.
- Verified Windows full debug tests: `xmake f -c -m debug -P .; xmake test -P .` passed 19/19.
- Verified WSL Arch Linux full debug tests: `XMAKE_ROOT=y xmake f -y -c -m debug -P . && XMAKE_ROOT=y xmake test -y -P .` passed 16/16.
