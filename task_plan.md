# CGPUI GPUI-Core 128-Step Plan

## Goal

Track small, verified implementation slices toward a Windows/Linux
GPUI-core-like API. Windows and Linux stay on Vulkan, Linux stays on Wayland,
and macOS/Cocoa + Metal remains an explicit readiness boundary until the
Windows/Linux core API is stable enough for parity work.

## Current Baseline

- `master` starts at `779e62c feat: add pointer capture owner`.
- Windows and Linux use Vulkan.
- Linux platform target is Wayland.
- Step 88 adds the explicit macOS/Cocoa + Metal target boundary without making
  macOS parity part of the active Windows/Linux implementation track.

## Definition Of Done For This 20-Step Goal

- All 20 steps below are implemented, committed, merged to `master`, and verified.
- Windows full debug test suite passes after each merge.
- Linux/WSL full debug test suite passes for slices that touch shared UI, platform, renderer, or build surfaces.
- `git status --short --branch` on `master` has no tracked/staged changes from the work, aside from the pre-existing untracked `.vscode/`.

## Definition Of Done For The 40-Step Goal

- Steps 1-20 remain implemented and verified on `master`.
- Steps 21-40 below are implemented, committed, merged to `master`, and verified.
- Windows full debug test suite passes after each merge.
- Linux/WSL full debug test suite passes for slices that touch shared UI, platform, renderer, or build surfaces.
- `git status --short --branch` on `master` has no tracked/staged changes from the work, aside from the pre-existing untracked `.vscode/`.

## Definition Of Done For The 60-Step Goal

- Steps 1-40 remain implemented and verified on `master`.
- Steps 41-60 below are implemented, committed, merged to `master`, and verified.
- Windows full debug test suite passes after each merge.
- Linux/WSL full debug test suite passes for slices that touch shared UI, platform, renderer, or build surfaces.
- `git status --short --branch` on `master` has no tracked/staged changes from the work, aside from the pre-existing untracked `.vscode/`.

## Definition Of Done For The 128-Step Goal

- Steps 1-88 remain implemented and verified on `master`.
- Steps 89-128 below are implemented, committed, merged to `master`, and verified.
- Each implementation step follows the existing RED/GREEN pattern with a
  targeted test that fails for the expected missing API or behavior before the
  implementation lands.
- Windows full debug test suite passes after each merge.
- Linux/WSL full debug test suite passes for slices that touch shared UI,
  platform, renderer, or build surfaces.
- macOS-specific code remains source-isolated behind macOS build guards until
  a dedicated Mac parity run begins.
- `git status --short --branch` on `master` has no tracked/staged changes from
  the work, aside from the pre-existing untracked `.vscode/`.

## Active Step

Step 91 is complete. Next implementation step is Step 92:
Style unit and color helpers: `px`, `rgb`, `rgba`, and edge constructors.

## Risks

- Keep old APIs source-compatible where practical while adding result-returning semantics.
- Avoid building a full view tree before the routing primitives exist.
- Keep each step small enough for Windows and WSL verification.
- Keep macOS readiness as a boundary/audit track until the Windows/Linux core
  API surface is stable enough to justify Metal parity work.
- Do not overfit authoring helpers to the current demo; each helper should be
  general enough to survive later view/model lifecycle work.
- Keep renderer work command-driven and platform-neutral first, then teach the
  Vulkan backend to consume the new commands.
