# CGPUI GPUI-Core Findings

## 2026-06-29 Baseline

- Current UI runtime has a single root `View`, a stable root `ViewId{1}`, input snapshots, keyboard focus owner, and pointer capture owner.
- `View::handle_event` currently returns `void`; changing this to an event result is the next routing prerequisite.
- Existing tests are concentrated in `tests/ui/window_runtime_test.cpp` and can verify runtime behavior without real platform windows.
- The main worktree has a pre-existing untracked `.vscode/` directory that should remain untouched.
